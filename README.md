# CODE CHALLENGE: NASA DRIVING ROVERS

The code is a Python program that simulates the movement of rovers on a plateau on Mars. It starts by defining a Rover class with methods to control its movement, rotation, and tracking its position and orientation. Then, the main program prompts the user for input of the size of the plateau and information about each rover, including its initial position and movement instructions. The code processes these instructions, checking if the rovers starts or ends in the same position at other rover any time. Finally, it displays the final positions and orientations of the rovers after completing the instructions. The program uses sets to keep track of the occupied positions and checks if the new motion is valid before updating the rover position. This code provides an interactive solution to the stated problem of controlling multiple rovers in a Mars environment.

## Requirements

You only need to have the project downloaded and python installed.

## Execution

To test the project it is necessary to run the file nasa_monitor.py in a terminal in order to enter the values requested.
